#FIXME proper system for re-using pre-built binaries
# we must require the vendor to provide signatures against a published public
# key. If they donâ€™t then really we should build ourselves or warn the user
# about the fact.
# The thing is, we trust the sources implicitly currently because signing is
# so rare. The only way wide spread signing will occur is via our protocol.

# This only works on macOS, arm64, monterey and above. It requires xcode 14.1 to build
