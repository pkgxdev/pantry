# this is a basic template for packages we strongly recommend looking at the
# contents of both:
#
# * https://github.com/pkgxdev/pantry
#
# as a learning guide and reference. For example, if you are package a `go`
# project, then browse the listings and find a go package.


# this is the source tarball. Swap the version out for {{version}} or we won’t
# be able to upgrade the package when it updates!
distributable:
  #url: https://example.com/v{{version}}.tar.gz
  url: https://github.com/containers/podlet/archive/refs/tags/{{ version.tag }}.tar.gz
  # this obscure option dictates how many components are removed from the
  # extracted tarball. It only works with tarballs. You almost always want
  # `1`. If after extraction the src-directory is funky try `0` or `2`.
  strip-components: 1
  # alternatively, we can use direct git checkouts from refs
  # but we should prefer official source distributions.
  # often CI/CD will do some post-processing of the source
  # for release, including setting version numbers, running
  # autotools, etc.
  #url: git+https://github.com/user/repo
  #ref: v{{version}}}

# if omitted, most tools will work by looking at either the provides: list, or require the
# fully-qualified name of the package. providing a display-name looks better in `pkgxdev/ossapp`
# and allows simpler commands like `pkgx install common-package-name`. this _should never_ conflict
# with any other display-name, or we will become upset and probably yell and stuff.
display-name: podlet

# if there’s a github then we can parse the versions
versions:
  # if the repo has a github then we can parse versions
  # this should be one of these (remove the rest or the YAML won’t parse)
  #github: user/repo  # reads github tags but only tags of releases (this is usually what you want)
  #github: user/repo/tags  # reads github tags from github
  #github: user/repo/releases  # reads github release *titles* (for some repos this can work better)
  github: containers/podlet

  # we also natively support gitlab releases and tags
  # including gitlab.com and self-hosted gitlab instances
  #gitlab: user/repo
  #gitlab: user/repo/tags
  #gitlab: user/repo/releases
  # we support using project IDs, which can be found in the project’s settings
  #gitlab: 1234567
  #gitlab: 1234567/tags
  #gitlab: 1234567/releases
  # and all of the above with a custom gitlab instance
  #gitlab: gitlab.example.com:user/repo
  #gitlab: gitlab.example.com:user/repo/tags
  #gitlab: gitlab.example.com:user/repo/releases
  #gitlab: gitlab.example.com:1234567
  #gitlab: gitlab.example.com:1234567/tags
  #gitlab: gitlab.example.com:1234567/releases

  # Alternatively, we have a generic web scraper that can parse versions from
  # any website. This is useful for projects that don’t have a github or
  # don’t use tags/releases. It works in three parts:
  #url: https://example.com/  # the url to scrape
  #match: /package-name-\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.tar\.gz/  # a regex to find versions
  # ^^ REMOVE ALL BUT ONE!

  # often maintainers prepend or append junk, this can be a single or an array of regexes.
  # almost always required with web scraping.
  strip:
    - /^prefixed-garbage-/
    - /-suffixed-garbage$/

# this is an key/list of platforms that the package supports
# usually omitted, which will default to all platforms
platforms:
  - darwin
  - linux/x86-64

dependencies:
  # to figure out dependencies you can read the project’s README
  # however it is often easier to read the [brew formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/)
  #
  # see dist.pkgx.dev for the packages pkgx provides
  # if you need a package that isn’t there, you may need to build it!
  #
  # see semver.org for version specifications
  #foo.com: ^1.2.3

build:
  dependencies:
    #cmake.org: ^3
    rust-lang.org: '>=1.7.0'
    rust-lang.org/cargo: '*'
    # ^^ use fully qualified names
  script: |
    #./configure $ARGS
    #make --jobs {{ hw.concurrency }} install
    cargo install --locked --path . --root {{prefix}}
  # ^^ it’s extremely common for packages to require the above

  # script also supports a list of commands, which is useful for complex builds
  # or if you want to run a command in a different directory
  #script:
  #  - ./configure $ARGS
  #  - make --jobs {{ hw.concurrency }} install
  #  - run: ls -l
  #    working-directory: ${{prefix}}/bin
  #  - run: cat $PROP > foo
  #    working-directory: ${{prefix}}/bin
  #    prop: |
  #      #!/bin/sh
  #      exec ./bar $@
  env:
    # add any environment variables here
    ARGS:
      - --prefix="{{prefix}}"


provides:
  #- bin/foo
  - bin/podlet
  # ^^ specify the binaries or pkgx shell integration won’t work

test:
  dependencies:
    #foo.com: '*'  # asterisk means “any version, usually the latest”
  script:
    #test "$(foo --version)" = {{version}}
    podlet --version | grep {{version}}
    # if it’s a tool check the version matches
    # you should run the tool to check it works!
    # if it's a library then you should *use* the library
    # don’t forget to check other package.ymls in the pantry for examples!
