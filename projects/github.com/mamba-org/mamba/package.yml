    #FIXME post-install, {{prefix}}/bin should ideally be added to path,
    # ^ because that's the point of using mamba: you do a `mamba install pkg_name` 
    # ^ and then you should be able to use `pkg_name` in your shell.
    # ^ at the moment, I'm not sure whether this should be a default behaviour of tea,
    # ^ or whether it should be up to a user to add the correct path to their shell config.
    # export PATH="${{prefix}}/bin:$PATH"
    # or
    #FIXME: add caveats
    # ^     Please run the following to setup your shell:
    # ^       conda init "$(basename "${SHELL}")"
    # ^ OR    mamba init "$(basename "${SHELL}")"
