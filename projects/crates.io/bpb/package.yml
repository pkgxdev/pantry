  # repo has no tags, presumably we can get the tags from crates.io, but not
  # sure how to do that at this time
  # we can find the versions here: https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index/blob/master/3/b/bpb
  # but converting those to a downloadable URL is a different story.
  # https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/bpb/1.1.0/download is one lead, but it downloads a .crate file
