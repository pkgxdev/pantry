This pantry† is the complement to [pantry.core].

Longer term it will be split out into more pantries, some of which we hope
will be maintained by their own communities.

> † see [pantry.zero] for “what is a pantry”

# Use with tea/cli

[tea/cli] clones/updates this pantry and [pantry.core] when installed with
the installer or when you run `tea --sync`. At this time pantries are not
versioned.

# Contributing

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/teaxyz/pantry.extra

$ cd pantry.extra
# all the following commands operate in `./tea.out`
# your tea installation remains untouched

$ xc init
# ^^ creates a “wip” package.yml

$ xc edit
# ^^ opens the new package.yml in your EDITOR

$ xc build
# ^^ will probably require a (zero permissions) GitHub [PAT].
# Using `gh auth login` is the easiest way to set this up.

$ xc test
# ^^ you need to write a test that verifies the package works

$ gh repo fork
$ git branch -m my-new-package
$ git push origin my-new-package
$ gh pr create
```

## Packaging Guide

Packaging can be cumbersome.
Our [wiki] is our packaging knowledge base.
For other assistance, start a [discussion].

## After Your Contribution

We build “bottles” (tar’d binaries) and upload them to both our centralized
bottle storage and decentralized [IPFS].

tea automatically builds new releases of packages *as soon as they are
released* (usually starting the builds within seconds). There is no need to
submit PRs for updates.

# Tasks

The following can all be run with `xc`, eg. `xc init`.

## Init

Creates a new package at `./projects/wip/$RANDOM_TEA_BLEND/package.yml`.

```sh
tea -E +tea.xyz/brewkit init
```

## Edit

Opens all wip packages in `$EDITOR`.

```sh
tea -E +tea.xyz/brewkit edit
```

## Build

Builds all wip packages to `./tea.out`.

```sh
tea -E +tea.xyz/brewkit build
```

## Test

Tests all wip packages.

```sh
tea -E +tea.xyz/brewkit test
```
